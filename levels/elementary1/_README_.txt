Trivia:

-The elementary school tracks were roughly conceptualized in 2013 along side the fairground and home tracks. 
-Lots of details and textures are directly from the elementary schools GJ and I_Spy attended.
-An example is the school bell sound effect (I_Spy spent hours making sure to find the right one).
-As well as the layout of the mudroom and kindergarten class.
-The tree species (boxelder and paper birch) and early autumn setting are authentic.
-The chalk drawing textures were done by GJ at a nearby park, and washed away by the rain a day later.
-The orange carpet was originally in the Home tracks, but we quickly realized it was better suited here.
-Art4.prm is a portrait made by GJs sister, depicting a band teacher she was not too fond of.
-Behind one of the classroom doors, a young GJ and his brother attempt to spell. The 22 year old recording is now a Re-Volt sound effect.

I SPY is reclusive, but if all else fails you can try to contact him instead. He also isn't a spy that's just his name.




We hope you thoroughly enjoy this track,
Thank you  :)
