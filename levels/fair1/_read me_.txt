Trivia:

-The original track ideas for fairground 1 and 2 date back to 2013.
-Textures and sounds were built using pictures and recordings from a real fairground.
-The splash texture was made when I SPY threw a souvenir cup into the street, breaking the cup in the process.
-The textures for livestock building were almost forgotten, and GJ had to run across the entire fairground to get them before it closed.

I SPY is reclusive, but if all else fails you can try to contact him instead. He also isn't a spy that's just his name.




We hope you thoroughly enjoy this track,
Thank you  :)
