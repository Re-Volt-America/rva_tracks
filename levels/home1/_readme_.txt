Trivia:

-The home theme was first planned as far back as 2013, though the layout and setpieces were different in concept.
-The piano interior and keys textures are a top down render of a hi-res grand piano model GJ built. The mesh was repurposed and poly-reduced for the piano instance ingame.
-Rain was added to the theme to differentiate it from other interior tracks, and to have the rain affect the house in a unique way not seen in tracks like Toytanic. It also has the narrative purpose of making it a rainy day in.
-The green floral couch pattern is an actual sofa fabric from GJ's childhood home. Who even has floral couches anymore?
-The cereal box, rings, and oatmeal are borrowed from an earlier, unreleased project.
-Some of the earlier resorces gathered for the TV animation were strange. A caveman stabbing a large duck, for example.
-The animation on the TV is part of a WB animation from the 1940's that lapsed into the public domain.
-picture1.prm includes an 1893 painting by Eugene Boudin.
-picture2.prm includes an 1871 painting by Claude Monet.
-picture3.prm is a portriat of Re-Volt dev Simon Harrison at his office.
