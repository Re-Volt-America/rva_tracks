Trivia:

-The school's name references the first names of two Re-Volt devs. 
-It also alludes to the highschool's name from School's Out by Kiwi. Perhaps the students will one day attend there.
-The chocolate milk texture is the same design and brand as the ones in the Supermarket tracks.
-Nearly every room includes a US flag, authentic to the setting of the tracks.
-The cafeteria is actually a multi-purpose room. It includes a stage for assemblies and basketball hoops for when converted into a gym.
-One of the cars parked near the school belongs to someone from a previous track theme of ours.
-The bus pictured in a movie poster downtown foreshadowed the school theme.
