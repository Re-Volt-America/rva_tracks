This is an alternate version of the first Spa-Volt.

Horray, the storm is over! The terrible nightly thunderstorm caused a lot
of damage to the environment, so the Spa kept closed the next day. This is
the perfect chance for having another RC-car race at Spa-Volt! :)

It was a sunny and warm day in the beginning of the autumn season. The sun
is going down in the next hour and throwing long shadows over the bathing
area. Crickets are using the chance for chirping maybe for the last time
this year. Crows are circeling above the Spa, searching for crickets for
their dinner. Who is the fastest in this most romantic and peaceful place
on earth?

Differences to Spa-Volt 1:

+ Weather: Sunny
+ Daytime: Evening
+ Surfaces: Still wet from the storm last night
+ Raceline: Much faster
+ Difficulty: A little bit easier
+ Also: Discover completly new areas!

Major features of Spa-Volt 2:

+ Fast but challenging raceline
+ Alternate routes
+ Reverse mode
+ Special starting position
+ A lot of customizations (sounds, moving objects...)
+ Can you collect all the 12 practice mode ducks?
+ 2 racing ducks waiting for a Quack-attack!
+ Time trial times to beat
+ More eastereggs to find

Have fun! :)

+ This track is only compatible and tested with RVGL
+ For best performance it's highly recommended to use RVGL's Shader Version
+ I got the idea for this track during an IRL Spa visit in February 2018
+ There is a forum thread with a creation diary, which can be found here:
  http://forum.re-volt.io/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=151

+ Possible graphical issues when using Non-Shader Version of RVGL,
  especially with mirroring effects and transparency.
+ Sometimes spark effects don't appear at all. This has something to do
  with a limitation of the amount of spark effects visible at the same
  time.
+ Big advantage in lap No. 1 in Time Trial mode, caused by the track
  concept.

Thank you to the original Probe developers for creating Re-Volt, and thank
you to Huki and Marv for keeping the game alive nearly 20 years after its
initial release by still improving and maintaining RVGL.

Thank you to the great Re-Volt community, for inspiring and motivating
me. Also big thanks to the ladies and gentlemen at the Discord's #tracks
channel, for your never-ending help for a track creator newbie like me.

Thank you to Gabor, Human and Hil, whose tracks inspired me a lot.

Thank you to my wife Bianca, who had to spend hundreds of evenings without
me, because I was working on Spa-Volt instead. ;-)
