hi there, im benderfan3124 and this is a collection of tracks i've made this summer. i hope you enjoy.
there is not much to them but i will try to make a simple description for all of them.

port limano ex takes places around the whole port limano. a huge thunderstorm totally transformed the aesthetics but the vibe persists. 
its a combination of port limano 1 and port limano 2. the rain particles are only visual and do not affect the materials. are you gonna come out on top?

thing to keep in mind is the ai which is not good as usual, i tried my best but i think they underperform.
