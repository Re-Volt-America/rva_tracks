Trivia:

-Before animated objects were added to RVGL, early ride prototypes were built using forcefeilds and objects. They consistently fell apart. One of them would launch into the stratosphere.
-The monkey prize is named after I SPY's favorite ice cream flavor
-GJ's favorite ride at the fair is the bumper car arena.
-The midway sign start line, test of strength u turn, and some of the ride obstacles were planned as far back as 2013.
