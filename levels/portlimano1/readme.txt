hi there, im benderfan3124 and this is a collection of tracks i've made this summer. i hope you enjoy.
there is not much to them but i will try to make a simple description for all of them.

port limano 1 is taking place at the market and mossy gardens part of port limano. it is a short and quick track where with stock pros it is possible to go under 20 seconds a lap. the switchback turns are fast and should make for a challenge for all the pros out there. have fun!

thing to keep in mind is the ai which is not good as usual, i tried my best but i think they underperform.
