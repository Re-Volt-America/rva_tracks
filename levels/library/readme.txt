Hi!

Thanks for downloading library!
I wanted it to feel like a stock track!

I'd be really happy to hear your feedback to make this track more pleasing to race.
Don't hesitate if you wanna help make the track a little bit better in any way!

A big thanks to Mighty who fixed the mirrors, and pretty much eveything that went wrong so far,
and the whole RV community for helping me out to update this track!

Have a nice day.
