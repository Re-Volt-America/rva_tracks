║   ║TRACK DESCRIPTION║
║   ╚═════════════════╝
║
║ "Kadish Sprint" is a track based upon the "URU : Ages Beyond Myst" level named Kadish Tolesa. Purple building, floating 
║ vault, stone pillars, trees... everything is inspired form that level (called "Ages" in that game).
║
║ Reverse mode is currently unavailable. It is planned for release in 2017.
║
║ Track music is from URU. However, it is not really a music but an ambiance.

║   ║KNOWN ISSUES║
║   ╚════════════╝
║
║ One Waterbox near the finish near the pedestal is placed in a way that cars flying in the air will hit them.
║ This issue occured because the Waterbox object cannot be rotated to allow a diagonal waterbox. However, this
║ do not affect the gameplay.
