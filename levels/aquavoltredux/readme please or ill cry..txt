It Has been a while since i made a level and I realy enjoyed it. I have been off sick from work with flu so it gave me pleny of time to build it.
The Max work for this track took 5 days and 2 days in Makeitgood.
Well Its just a follow on from where acclaim left off realy, a toyworld track with a sealife center theme.

Install as usual. just extract the zip to blahh blahh blahh...

Check out my Youtube page too.. I sing you know... I do honest.. Some people say that I aint too bad.
I play with my instrument, too I have a large one.....  Its wood and its got keys on it.
My guitar is wood too and i got this box thinggy called a Cajon, thats cool aswell coz you can whack the life out of it and it makes drumming noises.
