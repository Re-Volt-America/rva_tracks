Troubled Terrace - A Lego Track by yun

A short, Rookie-focused track full of slow and technical turns, with barely enough room to implement Super Pros driving around.
Makes use of "properties.txt" so that all pickups spawn regardless of how many racers are on the field.

It has a difficult challenge time meant for the Pro class, author time is "27.310" for anyone that is interested.

Uses custom music, they come from Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2.
