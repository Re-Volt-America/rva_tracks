After 6 months of work, this is my first track, and it's called Spa-Volt.

It's located at a typical Middle European Spa-Resort.

There is an indoor and an outdoor area. You drive beside the pools, through
the Spa-restaurant, and the changing room area. It's nighttime, and a
heavy autumn storm is going on. The gutters can't handle the amount of rain
anymore, the thunder is frightening. By contrast, the pools are still
romantically illuminated because the Spa was closed only 30 minutes before
the RC-cars took over. Not even the cleaning ladies were able to finish
their work! So, expect some chaos like mountains of laundry, and a fresh
delivery of unopened boxes full of mysterious rubber ducks. ;-)

Major features of Spa-Volt:

+ Open-World-like area
+ Challenging race line with a lot of alternative routes
+ Reverse mode
+ Lot of customizations (sounds, animations, materials, spark effects, ...)
+ 12 practice mode ducks ... ehhh ... stars
+ 2 racing ducks ... ehhh ... stars
+ Time trial times to beat
+ 3 ways to finish the race (Different Start/Finish lines)
+ Several eastereggs to find

Have fun, and a "relaxing" time at Spa-Volt! :-)

+ This track is only compatible and tested with RVGL
+ For best performance it's highly recommended to use RVGL's Shader Version
+ I got the idea for this track during an IRL Spa visit in February 2018
+ There is a forum thread with a creation diary, which can be found here:

+ FPS drops can happen, especially when looking at the pool spark effects.
+ Possible graphical issues when using Non-Shader Version of RVGL.
+ Sometimes spark effects don't appear at all. This has something to do
  with a limitation of the amount of spark effects visible at the same
  time.
+ Sometimes car shadows disappear. The source for this bug is unknown until
  now.
+ The AI doesn't take the jump back into the indoor area, because it would
  cause to many crashes for slower cars.

Thank you to the original Probe developers for creating Re-Volt, and thank
you to Huki and Marv for keeping the game alive nearly 20 years after its
initial release by still improving and maintaining RVGL.

Thank you to the great Re-Volt community, for inspiring and motivating
me to start working on my first track. Also big thanks to the ladies and
gentlemen at the Discord's #tracks channel, for your never-ending help for
a track creator newbie like me.

Thank you to Gabor, Human and Hil, whose tracks inspired me a lot.

Thank you to my wife Bianca, who had to spend hundreds of evenings without
me, because I was working on Spa-Volt instead. ;-)
