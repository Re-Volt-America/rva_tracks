Trivia:

-Indoor theme parks were a hot destination, the mix of familiar 90's and bizarre really made this track theme feel at home with some of the stock-content.
-The theme is also informed by my desire to do something a little crazy and unexpected, but still grounded enough to match the stock content with a fresh new flavor. We had recently just done a school, hospital and city. It felt like the right time to shake things up.
-Galaxy World is based on a couple of indoor parks and family activity centers. This is the type you might find at the heart of a sprawling mall.
-Palm trees are so 90s. They would find their way into buildings they had no right to be in. 
-The pizzeria and arcade include animatronic band members... like some kind of messed up, sci-fi Chuck E Cheese's you would dream about while suffering from a fever.
-The arcade games are based on the ones from Toy World and the Game Room tracks by Xarc. 
-Galaxy Shooter 2 is a sequel to one of the games in Game Room 1 & 2.
-The green alien mascot is named Bem-E.
-Ever since Rooftops 1 in 2019, we had been wanting to do something with a custom dragon model from Toy World 2. A guest artist drew up the alien animatronic, and from there I realized that this was a good chance to show off some vertex animation to get the arms and fabric to move more convincingly.
-Cut from Fairground 2 is sharing the track rails with a coaster ride. This time around we made the ride smaller, move slowly, and have some room on the sides. The original roller coaster obstacle from Fairground 2 would instead pummel you when you least expected it, your worst nightmare coming true as you are flung 100mph away from the race.
-By using custom BMO and BMR mipmaps, we were able to make the painted stars on the ground look metallic, with a dynamic glossy sheen!
-The tracker style soundtrack really hit the nostalgia vibes as well as evoking some arcade-park ambience. Cool stuff.
