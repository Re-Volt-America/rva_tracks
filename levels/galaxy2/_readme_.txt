Trivia:

-The game tickets texture is from a real arcade GJ and I Spy went to in their youth.
-The Starship Simulator 2000 may look like a familiar pop-sci-fi ship from the 90's.
-The officer's lounge is moved to the side of the ship for raceline purposes. It's only inspired by The Enterprise so pls don't string me up for all the glaring layout inaccuracies ST fans!
-One of the parks this was based on also had a large indoor lake for a brief amount of time before it was filled in.
-I Spy watched a bunch of 1990's commercials when writing the track descriptions. Can you tell? :)
-If you look at the books in Elementary Battle, you may notice one titled Galaxy World. Hmm. (anyone lucky enough to get the beta version will notice that book is instead titled "future world," because the track names changed soon before we finished the school tracks).
-We leaned in on making the shape of the track a bit more organic than our recent themes. New York City and elementary schools seem to be designed on a grid. Galaxy World (and it's real life counterpart) seems to be designed on a rumpled napkin.
