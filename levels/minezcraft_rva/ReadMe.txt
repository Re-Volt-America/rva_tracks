  This track is based loosely off of the game
Minecraft by Mojang.  The textures are borrowed
from an early version of the game and slightly
modified by myself.

  I did not build this model in Minecraft, I
simply made it up as I was modeling. Some obvious
changes would include, (as I've heard many times
from AGT :P ) incorrect ore distribution and
ramps for the racing line.

  Beware of the walls!  The sharp corners will
not hesitate to spin you in circles!
