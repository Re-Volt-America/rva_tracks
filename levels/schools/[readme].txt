1 PM. The last day of school is over. What about using the local high
school for some cool RC car races? Driving through the classrooms, the gym and 
the outdoor sports field, as well as the surrounding neighborhood. Is there
anything better to celebrate the beginning of the summer holidays? :)

This track is meant to be an ultimate tribute to the game we all love. Highly
influenced by custom stock-like gems like PetroVolt or Jailhouse Rock, the
track is also using well-known parts from Toys in the Hood and Supermarket.

Major features of School's Out!:

+ Long and diverse raceline
+ Reverse mode with a summer storm coming!
+ Practice mode star
+ Time trial times to beat
+ A lot of Re-Volt themed Easter eggs to find
+ Challenging AI made by Whitedoom
+ Exclusive music composed and arranged by Kirioso

Happy 20th Anniversary, Re-Volt!

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
+ This track is only compatible with RVGL 20.0210a or later. It's not
  compatible with the original (Vanilla) Re-Volt or Re-Volt 1.2.
+ For best performance and increased graphic quality, it's highly recommended
  to use the shader renderer. Set 'shaders = 1' in 'rvgl\profiles\rvgl.ini' 
  where 'rvgl' is the location of your RVGL installation.


  K N O W N    I S S U E S
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Issues caused by not using the shader renderer:

+ A much higher chances to get framedrops.
+ Graphical issues, especially flickering translucent faces and lights.

Issues caused by using an outdated RVGL version:

+ Camera sweep ("startgrid zoom") will not work if a RVGL version older
  then 20.0210a will be used.
+ Instead of the 64 pickups, only max. 37 pickups will spawn when using an
  RVGL version before 19.1230a. Support for up to 256 pickups was introduced
  in this version.
+ Issues with missing lights/shadows when not using RVGL version 19.1001a or
  later. The limit for lights was increased from 256 to 1024 in this version.
+ Issues with missing textures when using an RVGL version before 19.0120a.
  The support for up to 64 texture pages was introduced in this version.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
+ The high school is named after the people who created the game concept
  for Re-Volt in the late 90s: Paul Phippen and Simon Harrison.
+ The skateboard design with the half-naked woman was part of Re-Volt's
  Alpha and Demo versions, and was replaced by the orange texture in the
  final versions.
+ The red "Re-Volt" graffiti located in the sewer is taken from a texture 
  sheet which was made for a level named "Council Estate". The level didn't
  made it into the final release of Re-Volt.
+ The street names "Sheep Lane" and "Basil Road" were also present in Gabor
  Varga's track PetroVolt. Also the name of the fictional company in the 
  track Quake! was called "Basil Sheep Ltd". 
+ The logo from the fictional high school basketball team "Angry Pangas" is
  based on a picture of Panga which can be found in the gallery image lib4b.

Thank you to the original Probe developers for creating Re-Volt, and thank
you to Huki & the rest of the RVGL team for keeping the game alive 20 years
after its initial release.

Thank you to the great Re-Volt community, for inspiring and motivating
me. Also a big thanks to the ladies and gentlemen at the Discord's #tracks
channel, for your never-ending help.

Thanks to Gabor Varga, whose tracks inspired me a lot to do School's Out!

Thank you to my wife Bianca, who (again) had to spend so many evenings
without me, because I was working on School's Out! instead. ;-)
