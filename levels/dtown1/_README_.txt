Trivia:

-Preproduction started in September 2021. Development was delayed a few times but we hit our stride in April of 2023. 
-The cobbles have a unique bump pattern to match the material.
-The water in the second sewer segment creates a dynamic wake behind the moving cars.
-The sides of the police cars read "NVPD," as the level is set in New Volt City. 
-The city streets theme and the dynamic traffic to go with it was planned in the summer of 2019 as we began to make tracks.
-There are kiwis in one of the market baskets referencing Kiwi: the creator of Spa-Volt (which inspired us to finally start building tracks).
-The mug in the cafe sign is likely a reference to the amount of coffee GJ drinks.
-The bike was last seen in the attic and garage of Home 2. Now it's a yellow version.
-On the calender prop in Home 1 and 2, we included a subtle hint of the upcoming traffic obstacles that are in this theme.
