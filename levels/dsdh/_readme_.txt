Description:

This is Mario Kart's DS Desert Hills in its Wii version. I tried to do a conversion as exact as possible.

Very special thanks to CapitaineSZM (doing the MKRV pack) and Vas0Sky (doing similar conversions in the past). You both inspired me to do this track. More tracks in the same style will maybe follow!

Features:

+ Included original music
+ Reverse Version
+ Self-made animated objects (Pokey, Fire Snake, Angry Sun)
+ Time trial time and Practice mode star
