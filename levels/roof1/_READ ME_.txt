Description:

It's all full-throttle and precise control at the top of the city! 
Sun baked rooftops rest above pale clouds that mask what must be a frightening drop.
Watch out for steam obstacles that will push you off course.
Battle against other fearless toy cars to prove again that you are the true Re-Volt Champion!

This level was patched on 5/2/2020! There is a changelog included just a bit below here as well as some additional highly interesting trivia near the base of this document, if that's your cup of tea. 


This track is built and intended for RVGL! I have no idea if it works elsewhere but to be safe just use RVGL.

It uses Marv's awesome FIDDLERS ON THE ROOF as a base, and reworked it with the intention of making 
it pair with Acclaim's ROOFTOPS by Jim Vale. The result is a prequel to the dreamcast track.

It's also reversable now, and any stock car can race it forwards and backwards on any mode.
(even Phat Slug on Junior RC (but why would you do this?); though the satilite Jump may be a bit tricky for him).

Also there's a couple new obstacles based on the concept art from fliddlers on the roof, so don't expect the same
race experience as before (especially at the bridge shortcut, it'll literally blow you away! <<Or, as of the most recent patch, we will tear it down because it was a bit s#!t>>)

IMPORTANT!
You will need the latest version of RVGL! (Custom Animated Objects are included now)
You will need to have the dreamcast pack enabled! (For sound effects from the rooftops)
You will NO LONGER need to have particles enabled to the highest setting to see the air vents and steam mains, they are built to be visible at all times now.

5/2/2020 - UPDATE CHANGELOG

-New birds! 

-Geometry and edgeflow has been improved to fix lighting errors, and now the world shouldn't peel apart when firing a shockwave anymore.

-Fixed model colors on instances to match the lighting

-A handful of gouraud shading errors have been fixed

-Additional lights and shadow boxes have been added 

-The high winds bridge has been removed. There is actually nothing there anymore, if you try to take the now defunct shortcut you'll just run into a wall.

-The steam valves on the factory roof have been repaired.

-The steam blasts on the factory roof are more visible, and the forcefeilds are more realistic in magnitude and turbulance. 

-The AC ground vents near the construction site will no longer lift you in a cartoonish way. The magnitude is more realistic and you will tumble in a more convincing manner.

-The AC air currents are more visible.

-The open skylights on the green-roofed warehouse have been closed, the skylights have moved closer together to fix pacing issues and improve visibility of AC obstacles.

-The building with AC vents before the construction site has been extended. The blind jump is gone and there's more room to avoid the AC obstacles.

-The reversed path from the factory roof has been redone. The thin pipe path was replaced by a more approachable catwalk and lane change drop.

-The water stream and pool have been recolored. The water stream is smoother and shaded properly. 

-The texture based shadows have been color corrected to remove gouraud shading errors.

-New texture for the metal beams beneath the satilite jump

-Camera triggers repaired

-Additional cameras added to capture the moment you fall over the edge and plummet to your doom.

-AI pathing improved

-Time trial times have changed after the removal of the bridge.

-Start sweep camera added

-Level is locked until championship is complete

This is our (GJ and I Spy) fourth custom track, and the first one to be released into the wild. 
(The other three didn't make the grade)

Framerate drops can happen in a couple of specific places depending on settings. Most of the time it should be fine.

General Info and Differences from Marv's Fiddlers on the Roof: (AKA read this for cool trivia)

The name "Rooftops 1" was decided upon given the history of this track. 
The original Meshes (seen in Marv's Fiddlers on the Roof) were developed starting in 1997 by Acclaim,
but the track had to be scrapped for several reasons. Jim Vale picked the track apart and built 
Rooftops for the dreamcast version of the game. Chronologically, this is technically the first iteration 
and therefor the prequel to Jim Vales interpretation of the theme. 

Rooftops 1 was built using some geometry from Vale's track, so the satilites, vents, 
exhaust, building designs, were replicated from Rooftops to Rooftops 1. This was to make the track match 
Rooftops as a single theme. 'I Spy' and I decided to make it daytime, as the Rooftops theme was originally 
intended until Vale had to redo some textures to make it night due to the draw distance. I took textures
that he had modified, the ones with emmisive designs, and daytime'd them as accurately as possible (brick for brick).
So this is how that very city looks once the sun has risen. The window reflections were designed to match how
Acclaim lit their daytime windows in Toys in the Hood and Ghost Town, only at a larger scale.

Because Rooftops 1 is does not have much cloud cover compared to Fiddlers on the Roof, soft diffuse shadows are
replaced by sharp daytime shadows seen in other tracks such as Ghost Town and Toys in the Hood. 
The lighting is also inspired by the warm lighting in the concept art for Acclaim's Fiddlers on the Roof.

The original concept art, Which can be found here (https://revolt.fandom.com/wiki/The_Re-Volt_1999_Scrapbook_Deluxe),
also included a construction site with red girders and scaffold planks just after the air vents. It appears that this
was replaced(?) with the pathway with three arches (known as "sraight" in the source geometry). I initially kept that geometry,
but found that because I was clueless on how it would have looked, it just wasn't working. Vale incorporated it onto
a rooftop as the start position in Rooftops, and there it is an iconic location. Since I wanted this track to stand on its 
own from Fiddlers while still being a prequel to Rooftops, I decided to rework the arches into the construction area from the concept art.
The path is the same, just without the sloped edges the path made into planks, and the three arches have been 
squared off and embeded into the jumble of girders. It looked so much better than what I was working on earlier so I kept it
that way.

Marv's set of buildings across the horizon were awesome and made the track feel like a part of a big metropolis, but because 
I intended to rely on Vale's geometry design as a crutch, they had to get cut. I made the buildings on the peripheral closer and
not too much taller than the track to give the feeling of being at the very top of the city and to correspond to the design of 
Rooftops, just with plenty more buildings. 

The thin bridge shortcut was too convienient and literally no one in their right mind would take the default level path that
leads to the staircases with a view. I believe 'I Spy' had the idea to keep the pickups exlusive to the longer path, and to
add the high winds seen in the original track plan by Paul Phippen. That way racers would have to slow down and be more experienced 
with handling if they wanted to skip a bit of the track. <<It worked better in theory than practice, so it was removed>>

In reversed mode we added a bit of ventilation to add more variety to that race experience. 'I Spy' had the awesome idea for the 
vent cover. 

Only one practice star, it should be fun :)



Additional Trivia (5/2/2020)

There are new birds that spook away as you get near them. This is something we had planned on putting in this track originally, but before custom animated objects this just wasn't possible.
We had considered using ball launchers and making them look like birds, but the prospect was laughable at best.
