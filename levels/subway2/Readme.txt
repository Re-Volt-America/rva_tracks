Thanks for downloading Subway 2!

There's still room for improvement (especially AI and cameras) but I hope you like the track!
It was lot of work, and keeping interest on a track for so long was quite hard, so this might be my
last re-volt track.
Thanks everyone for the feedback on the first subway themed track.

Once again, if you're willing to improve the track in any way you are more than welcome to contact
me by discord / ReVolt World :)

And thank you and the whole RV community for keeping the game alive.

So long,

Update v1.1 - by EstebanMz
==========================
- .w file has passed through WorldCut by jigebren, which reduces drastically 
the loading times for users with low-spec hardware (download and more info here 
https://web.archive.org/web/20220801082102/http://jigebren.free.fr/games/pc/re-volt/#worldcut)
- AI Nodes has been redone from scratch for both normal and reverse version. 
Now any reposition issues should've been dissapeared and AI for single-player now is quite competitive.
- Pick-ups has new spawn placements. You can find them more often without leaving the raceline 
and thus without missing time.
- Triggers has been tweaked. Some track direction and reposition boxes were modified, so it's harder 
to both players and AI to take a wrong way.
- Time trials and a Practice star has been added. 01:04:000 and 01:14:000 are the times to beat 
(Toyeca is the suggested car).
- Typo in one of the textures fixed. No more "FAIRGOUND" in giant letters, furthermore, all textures 
are now saved as PNG format.
- Special thanks to yun for testing and feedback related to the changes to the AI.
