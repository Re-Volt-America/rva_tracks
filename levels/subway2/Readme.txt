Thanks for downloading Subway 2!

There's still room for improvement (especially AI and cameras) but I hope you like the track!
It was lot of work, and keeping interest on a track for so long was quite hard, so this might be my
last re-volt track.
Thanks everyone for the feedback on the first subway themed track.

Once again, if you're willing to improve the track in any way you are more than welcome to contact
me by discord / ReVolt World :)
