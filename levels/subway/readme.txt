Thanks for downloading Subway!

There's still room for improvement (especially AI) but hope you like the track!
I've got a concept for Subway2, but we'll see if I gather the motivation for this second episode.

If you're willing to improve the track in any way you are more than welcome to contact me on
discord / ReVolt World :)
