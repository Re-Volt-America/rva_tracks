Track: Market Mayhem
Difficulty: Medium
Length: ~450 meters

Hello! Taking a break from making cars for a while, I've decided to make my first track! This time it's a new track using the stock supermarket tileset made by Acclaim. Despite this being my first experience in track making, I didn't want to make the final result look and feel cheap. As such, I put many hours of effort into designing the layout, and testing (with some help from some kind users). The track features all of the stock tracks content, such as practice stars, reverse mode, and time trial challenge times. It also features many alternate routes and shortcuts for different types of vehicles, so choose the best combination of routes for your vehicle to win a race!

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this track, and thanks for downloading!

Special thanks to TT for testing and providing feedback, and Zeino for teaching me some stuff about track making
