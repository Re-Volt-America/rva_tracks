;====================================
;	  TRACK DESCRIPTION
;====================================

StadVolt is my first successful attempt at 3D modeling and UV mapping.
The track's goal is to give a try at the most RVGL features possible for a future project idea.
The racing line is rather easy to navigate through, except for some hazards along the way.

Reversed Mode, Practice Star and Challenge Time available. Track tested with RVGL 20.0930a

Thanks to javildesign for his valuable help throughout the development of the track and his constructive feedback.
Thanks also to the Re-Volt Community at large, full of passionate and talented people.

February-September 2020, made by L17.
