Description:
This is my entry for the Spooktober 2022 contest.
It is a super special stage, which means half of the cars start in a different part of the track, and it will take 2 laps to browse the entire track.
One part of the track will take you in a relaxing autumn landscape, the other part is hidden from the first part and will take you in some spooky caves. Be careful, there are some creatures, some of them may try to attack you!
There is a star in each part of the track.

The time trial times have been set for Semi-Pro cars. For a harder challenge, play with an Advanced car.

I haven't used a music that fits any of the themes, because it would be adapted to only one part of the track. Instead I have choosen something that I think is in-between.

Known issues:
+ Some force fields cover the same area in the lakes, which doubles their intensity.
+ Some areas may have a lot of lights at the same time, too many for the game to display all of them with the default values.
+ Some lights from the strobes placed in one part of the track are sometimes visible on the other part of the track.

Tools used:
>>> Photofiltre for textures
>>> Blender with Marv's plugin.
>>> RVGL (Makeitgood)
>>> WorldCut
>>> Visual Studio Code for custom animations and editing the inf file (though I also use the notepad when I'm on a computer that doesn't have VS Code; also used it in the past without mentioning it).
